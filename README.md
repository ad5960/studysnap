## Algorithm

StudySnapâ€™s machine learning algorithm categorizes questions into three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and difficult. This classification is based on the following:

1. **Training Data**: A collection of software engineering questions answered by prior users, compared with the correct answers to label difficulty.
2. **Features**: Consideration of question length, answer length, author, and other relevant aspects.
3. **Classification**: If all prior users answered correctly, the question is marked as easy, and so forth.

After classifying difficulty, the system utilizes an optimal learning sequence, starting with easy questions and gradually progressing to medium and difficult ones. This strategy follows a pedagogical approach where a gradual increase in challenge aligns with the natural learning curve, aiding comprehension and memory retention.
