RUN SERVER:

To run server, navigate to quizmaster/main_code and run "python manage.py runserver" - Copy IP address into your browser. 

If this doesn't work, try use "python3" - make sure to have django installed.

pip install django

- Update backend with frontend

- Create teacher dashboard for when users try to login

        - if you look in accounts/views --> you'll see login view has a redirect to "dashboards" - currently it is pointing to the "create new card template" as a place holder.
                - this needs to be changed to display dashboard
